A small and simple SQLite clone made with C

## Installation

Simply just run

First, download [this file](https://github.com/Xytrux/XyDB/releases/download/XyDB/compile.sh)

Next, you want to run it by changing your directory where you put the file. (preferably in root)

Then, you can run it:

```
bash compile.sh
```

You may need to run `source ~/.bashrc` in order for the command to keep working.

Finally, just run `xydb <database name>`

## Commands

Basically, you use this EXACTLY how you would use SQLite
